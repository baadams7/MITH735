## **Scholarly Goals of the Project:**

We will offer substantial feedback when prompted and assume that feedback is otherwise unwanted.
We will share resources as we find them.
We are committed to offering tangible help (e.g. troubleshooting, feedback, resources, etc.) whenever we have the capacity to do so, but no more than that.
We will listen to each other attentively and ask clarifying questions to push our scholarship in new directions.

## **Sustainability Considerations:**
As we are working on distinct projects with unique sustainability needs and considerations, we agree to help each other develop reasonable sustainability strategies for our projects as appropriate. We will each seek funding and other sustainable and environmentally conscious ways to produce our projects. We agree to share any sources that may be appropriate for our individual projects.

## **Statement on Shared Credit:**
Because we are working on separate project autonomously, we agree to acknowledge each other as helpful to the work if it every reaches a public deliverable stage, but not to share credit per se. We are dedicated to ethically supporting each other and acknowledging that our projects were formed within a community of engaged and dynamic scholars.
